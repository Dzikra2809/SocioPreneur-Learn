    <p>
      The year 2024 has ushered in a new revolution in the world of work, where AI technology and the flexibility of remote working are no longer a dreamed-of future, but a lived reality. 
    </p>
    <p>
        	Generation Z is often associated with lazy people who don't want to work hard. We can't fault such a statement, but it's also not entirely true. In the world of work, gen Z tends to be more creative. They look for ways to make money without having to spend extra effort. 
    </p>
    <p>
        	The trend of remote work rose in the year. During the Covid-19 pandemic, remote working has become increasingly popular and a favorite for many employees. Companies implementing remote working patterns are also considered normal. "Remote work is basically being done because of this pandemic," said Nicholas Bloom, professor of economics at Stanford University, as quoted from CNBC.
    </p>
    <p>
        	According to Bloom, before the pandemic, remote work was rare. All managers and professionals basically did remote work for most of 2020. "And apparently it worked very well," he said.
    </p>

    <p>
        	What about the development of remote work this year? Remote work in 2024 is more in demand by generation z people, why is that? Because basically registration or how to apply for the job is not as difficult as applying for a job in the office in general.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we apply in a direct office, there must be necessary criteria such as age restrictions, educational background or last education of at least S1, and the skills possessed must be diverse. Whereas when we apply as remote workers, we only need 1 specific skill that we are experts in, then we create a portfolio, then send it directly to the company or person who created the job vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
        	In addition to these methods, we can also invite people to contact us without having to send job applications. They are workers who usually share their work on social media, thus attracting employers or indeed people who are looking for labor for the project being run.
    </p>
    <p>
        	The advantage we have when we do this remote work is that we don't have to bother coming to the office. We can work at home, cafes, or places that make us comfortable in doing it. Very pleasant, right? But don't forget that every job has its own challenges and difficulties.
